# Roadmap-to-make-career-in-kernel-space
üìç Roadmap for Kernel Space Career (Starting 1st Semester)

Year 1 (Fundamentals & C Mastery)

üëâ Goal: Build strong foundations in C, OS basics, and computer architecture.

C Programming (Core Language for Kernel)

Pointers, arrays, memory allocation

Structures & unions

Function pointers

Bitwise operations

File I/O (important for system calls & device drivers)


Computer Organization & Architecture

CPU, registers, memory hierarchy

Instruction cycles, interrupts

Assembly basics (x86, ARM if possible)


Linux Basics

Learn Linux command line deeply (bash, grep, awk, sed, strace, gdb)

Understand file permissions, processes, signals


Projects/Practice

Implement your own ls, cp, cat in C

Write small C programs to interact with /proc and /sys

Use gdb to debug C programs




---

Year 2 (Systems Programming & OS Internals)

üëâ Goal: Dive into OS concepts, write system-level C code.

Operating Systems (Theory + Implementation)

Process management (fork, exec, wait)

Scheduling algorithms

Memory management (paging, segmentation, virtual memory)

File systems (ext4 basics)

Synchronization (mutex, semaphores, spinlocks)


Advanced C & Systems Programming

Signals & IPC (pipes, message queues, shared memory)

Sockets programming

Multithreading with pthreads


Linux Kernel Basics

Read ‚ÄúLinux Kernel Development‚Äù by Robert Love

Explore /usr/src/linux and start reading kernel code (start with init, fs, kernel/)


Projects/Practice

Implement your own shell in C

Implement producer-consumer using shared memory & semaphores

Modify a small part of the Linux kernel (like adding a new syscall)




---

Year 3 (Kernel Development & Drivers)

üëâ Goal: Specialize in kernel space development.

Linux Kernel Internals

System call interface

Process scheduling (CFS)

Memory management (slab/slub allocator, paging)

File system internals


Device Drivers (Critical Skill)

Read ‚ÄúLinux Device Drivers‚Äù by Jonathan Corbet

Start with simple character drivers (hello world kernel module, /dev entries)

Explore block drivers and network drivers later


Concurrency in Kernel

Spinlocks, atomic operations, RCU

Interrupt handling (ISR, bottom halves, tasklets, workqueues)


Projects/Practice

Write a kernel module (hello_world.ko)

Write a simple char driver (keyboard logger, pseudo device)

Modify the Linux scheduler (experiment with priorities)




---

Year 4 (Advanced Specialization & Career Prep)

üëâ Goal: Contribute to open source & prepare for jobs/research.

Specializations (Pick one or two)

Kernel subsystems (scheduler, memory, filesystems, networking)

Embedded Linux (for IoT, ARM-based devices)

Security (Linux hardening, kernel exploits)


Contribute to Open Source

Join Linux kernel mailing list (LKML)

Start fixing small bugs in Linux kernel (look for ‚Äúgood first issue‚Äù patches)

Contribute to projects like QEMU, BusyBox, eBPF, systemd


Tools to Master

git (for kernel patches, mailing list workflow)

qemu (for kernel testing)

perf, ftrace, bpftrace (for kernel performance debugging)


Career Path

Internships in companies working with kernel (Red Hat, SUSE, Intel, NVIDIA, ARM, Qualcomm, etc.)

Higher studies in Systems/OS if aiming for research




---

üîë Key Skills to Build Alongside

Programming: Expert in C, basics of C++ & Rust (Rust is entering Linux kernel).

Assembly: At least basic understanding (x86/ARM).

Mathematics: Discrete Math, Probability, Graphs (used in OS algorithms).

Problem-Solving: Practice low-level coding (like Codeforces, not just LeetCode).
